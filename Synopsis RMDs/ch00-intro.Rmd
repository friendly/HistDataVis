#### Synopsis {-}

This book recounts a long history, a broad overview of how, where, and why the
methods of data visualization, so common today, were conceived and developed.
You can think of it as a guided tour of this history, focusing on social and
scientific questions and a developing language of graphics that provided
insights, for both discovery and communication.
