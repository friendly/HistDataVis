# The Golden Age of Statistical Graphics {#ch07-golden}


```{block, type="chapterprelude"}
#### Synopsis {-}
In the latter half of the 19th Century, enthusiasm for graphical methods
matured, and a variety of developments in statistics, data collection and
technology combined to produce a "perfect storm" for data graphics. The result
was a qualitatively distinct period that produced works of unparalleled beauty
and scope, the likes of which would be hard to duplicate today. We argue that
this period deserves to be recognized as the "Golden Age of Statistical
Graphics."
