# The Origin and Development of the Scatterplot {#ch06-scat}

```{block, type="chapterprelude"}
#### Synopsis {-}
Among all the moderns forms of statistical graphics,
the scatterplot may be considered the most versatile,
and generally useful invention in the entire history of statistical
graphics. It is also notable because William Playfair didn't invent it.
This chapter considers why Playfair was unable to think about such things,
and it traces the invention of the scatterplot to the eminent astronomer John F. W. Herschel.
Scatterplots achieved great importance in the work
of Francis Galton [1822--1911] on the heritability of traits.
Galton's work, visualized through statistical diagrams,
became the source of the statistical ideas of correlation and regression and thus most of
modern statistical methods.
