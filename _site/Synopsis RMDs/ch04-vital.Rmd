#### Synopsis {-}

A short time later, analogous widespread data collection was begun in the United Kingdom, but this
was in the context of social welfare, poverty, public health and sanitation.
From these efforts emerged two new heroes of
data visualization, William Farr and John Snow, who worked independently trying to
understand the causes of several epidemics of cholera and how the disease could
be mitigated.
