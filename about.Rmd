## Who needs this book?

The book is aimed at an educated, lay audience: in general anyone who must either convey or receive quantitative information, which at one time or another includes all of us. This includes, but is not limited to, 
graphic designers, statisticians, and people in the media. Typical audiences would be readers of the 
*NY Times*, *The New Yorker*, *Scientific American*, the *New Republic*,  *National Review* and related
publications in other venues.

A more specific market segment is the large community of professionals in the history of science, cartography, data journalism, graphic design, and information visualization, visualization software.
