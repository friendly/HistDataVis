These web pages are meant as a supplement to our book, 
[A History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975231).
The main goals are to:

* reproduce here more color figures than could be accommodated in the print edition.
* provide links to [related papers](related.html) and topics that expand on the themes in our book.

## Who needs this book?

The book is aimed at an educated, lay audience: in general anyone who must either convey or receive quantitative information, which at one time or another includes all of us. This includes, but is not limited to, 
graphic designers, statisticians, and people in the media. Typical audiences would be readers of the 
*NY Times*, *The New Yorker*, *Scientific American*, the *New Republic*,  *National Review* and related
publications in other venues.

A more specific market segment is the large community of professionals in the history of science, cartography, data journalism, graphic design, and information visualization, visualization software.

The design of the front cover is based on William Playfair's (1805)
marvelous
_Chart of Universal Commercial History_. In it, he asks: 

* How and when did civilizations rise and fall from 1500 BCE to 1800 AD?

He shows ancient and modern civilizations in the form of small graphs
over time, representing some indication of strength of an empire
or civilization, in a way that then can be visually compared to
ask further questions: 

* Why were some so long-lived? 
* When and why did some of them fail?

Another implicit question is: 

* How to visualize a history and tell its story?

This chart, like our book, takes a long view of history, with the necessity
of some degree of abstraction. These questions also provide a structure
for discussing the history of data visualization.


Playfair's chart uses what at the time was a brilliant and
novel graphic form: using compressed little distributions showing the "relative" strength
of each civilization over time in a way thay they could be easily compared. 
The colored bands reflect: 

* ancient states (pink)
* modern states (green)
* America (yellow)

This graphic form was recently re-invented
and called a ``ridgeline'' plot because it resembles a set of
mountain ridges. This figure appears as Plate 8 in the book
and is discussed in Chapter 5, "Charts of History".
