# Escaping Flatland {#ch08-flatland}

#### Synopsis {-}
Displays of data are necessarily produced on a two-dimensional surface-- paper or screen. Yet 
these are often at worst, misleading, or at best, incomplete. The representation of multidimensional phenomena on a two-dimensional surface was, and remains, graphics greatest challenge. In this chapter we discuss and illustrate some of the approaches that were used to communicate multidimensional phenomena within the practical limitations that we are always faced with.
