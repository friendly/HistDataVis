  (middle smoothings, spread smoothings, and upper and lower smoothings), and

  smoothings, sum-difference smoothings, scale-ratio smoothings, and polar

  based on the recognition that most datasets include both categorical and
  quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure
  important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but
  coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of
  paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot,
  fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two
  categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram,
  or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A
  traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical
  variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary
  statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example.
  By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure
  in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of
  exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations
  of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for
  this article are available online on the journal web site.}

  abstract = {If there ever was a tool that could stimulate the imagination and
  profit from the intuition and creativity of John Tukey, it was computer
  graphics. John always saw graphics a being central to exploratory data
  analysis: "Since the aim of exploratory data analysis is to learn what seems
  to be, it should be no surprise that pictures play a vital role in doing it
  well. There is nothing better than a picture for making you think of
  questions you had forgotten to ask (even mentally)." Much of his work focused
  on static displays designed to be easily drawn by hand, but he realized that
  if one wanted to effectively explore multivariate data, computer graphics
  would be an ideal tool. PRIM-9, the first program to use interactive, dynamic
  graphics for viewing and dissecting multivariate data, was conceived by John
  during a four month visit to the Computation Research Group of the Stanford
  Linear Accelerator Center in early 1972. PRIM-9 opened up a fundamentally new
  way of exploring multivariate data. Its basic operations-Picturing, Rotation,
  Isolation and Masking-have stood the test of time and form the core of
  numerous follow-on systems. John's experiences with PRIM-9 gave rise to a
  slew of other ideas for the analysis of multivariate data, many of them not
  tied to interactive graphics. The most well known of those is "Projection
  Pursuit"- automatically finding interesting low-dimensional projections of
  multivariate data by optimizing a projection index. John was also keenly
  interested in ways of detecting and modeling nonlinear structures in
  multivariate data which might not be manifest in projections, such as
  concentration of data near nonlinear lower dimensional manifolds. Many of his
  proposals exist only in the form of handwritten notes and appear "far out"
  even today. John's work on Prim-9 and Projection Pursuit lent respectability
  to computationally oriented, non mathematical research in Statistics. He
  moved the center of gravity away from an (over)emphasis on mathematical
  theory to a greater balance between methodology, theory, and applications and
  thereby helped revitalize the discipline of Statistics.}

  National des Arts et M\`etiers (CNAM) in Paris sheds new light on the
  invention by Andr\'e-Michel Guerry of a mechanical device for obtaining
  statistical summaries and for examining the relationship between different
  variables, well before general purpose statistical calculators and the idea
  of correlation had even been conceived. Guerry's ordonnateur statistique may
  arguably be considered as the first example of a mechanical device devoted to
  statistical calculations. This article describes what is now known about this
  machine and illustrates how Guerry probably used it in his program of
  statistique analytique to reason about the relationship of types of crimes to
  various potential causes or associations. Supplementary materials for this
  article are available online.}

  considered. We also show the peril of over-interpreting correlations in

  remains unknown. In this study, a construction procedure is hypothesized that
  uses mathematical tools that were available in his day, namely arithmetical

The possible effects of factors which could modify the nature of these responses (obesity, age, sex, family history of diabetes, and indications for performing the tolerance test) have been extensively evaluated. None of these variables were found to have a statistically significant effect on the plasma glucose and insulin responses. Two general relationships between glucose and insulin responses have been defined within the population studied. One, based on the quantitative aspects of the glucose and insulin responses, indicated that there was at first an increase, and then, a decrease in the insulin response to progressive degrees of hyperglycemia. The second relationship was independent of the absolute concentrations of either glucose and insulin, and states that the pattern of glucose response during the three hours of the tolerance test determines the pattern of the insulin response during this same time interval.},
