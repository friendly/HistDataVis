This is the web site associated with our book,
[A History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication, Harvard University Press, 2021](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975231).
It's main purpose is to provide high-res color images of figures from the book, because the print edition was limited
to 20 color plates.

As well, it serves as a place to collect related articles or topics that could not be included in the print edition.

## What it is about

To function in modern society we must absorb and understand complex data at a
breakneck pace. The most efficient way to comprehend and convey complex
information is through data-based graphics. This book is an exploration and
celebration of the origins and, to some extent, future of graphical methods of
data presentation.

It aims to give a comprehensive history of data visualization with an emphasis
on the questions: 

* How did the graphic depictions of numbers arise? Why? 
* What factors led to the key innovations in graphs and diagrams that are commonplace today? 
* How did graphic inventions make a difference in understanding natural and social phenomena and communicating results?

Two major themes connect the topics and and chronology of this account. 

* First, we take the view that the principal innovations over the last 400 years arose in
conjunction with a cognitive revolution we call "visual thinking," the idea that
some problems and their solutions could be so much more clearly addressed and
communicated in visual displays, rather than just words or tables of numbers.

* Second, we try to show how the intellectual, scientific and graphical questions
behind these innovations can be better understood by trying to reproduce them
today.
