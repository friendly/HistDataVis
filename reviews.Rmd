## Capsule reviews of our book

"A masterly study of graphic innovations, their context, and their scientific use. This brilliant book, without equivalent, is an indispensable read." 
-- **Gilles Palsky, coauthor of _An Atlas of Geographical Wonders_**

"Friendly and Wainer are the Watson and Crick of statistical graphics, showing us the history of the DNA structure that is the code of life for innovative visualizations." 
-- **Ben Shneiderman, founder of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland**

"Data expertise is a fundamental prerequisite for success in our digital age. But exactly how, and when, have we learned to draw conclusions from data? For decades, Michael Friendly and Howard Wainer have been studying how data has informed decision-making, through visualization and statistical analysis. Replete with mesmerizing visual examples, this book is an eye-opening distillation of their research."
-- **Sandra Rendgen, author of _History of Information Graphics_**

"Michael Friendly and Howard Wainer have given us a wonderful history of the dazzling field of data visualization. They bring new life to ancient death statistics and describe the artistic poetry used to display numbers. An intriguing story of how we have learned to communicate data of all types."
-- **Stephen M. Stigler, author of _The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom_**

"Two of the most distinguished scholars of data visualization give us a glimpse of ancient attempts to quantify the world, before revealing the century-long revolution that led to the invention of modern statistics and many of the graphical methods we use today. I learned a lot from this book, and I think you will too."
-- **Alberto Cairo, author of _How Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information_**

"Friendly and Wainer demonstrate the amazing progress that has been made in data graphics over the past two hundred years. Understanding this history-where graphs came from and how they developed-will be valuable as we move forward."
-- **Andrew Gelman, coauthor of _Regression and Other Stories_**

"The invention of graphs and charts was a much quieter affair than that of the telescope, but these tools have done just as much to change how and what we see."
-- **Hannah Fry, _The New Yorker_**
